This script helps me check my other program's results by counting the total length and adding up times in m:s format. 
It converts each time to seconds, adds them up, and then converts the total into h:m:s format so I can easily see and compare the result.
ChatGPT was unfortunatly unreliable for that, so here's my quick script TwT

"""
List comprehension is a quick and elegant way to create lists in Python.
It lets you generate a new list by looping through an existing one and applying a transformation or filterâ€”all in a single line of code.
It's shorter, faster, and more readable than a traditional for loop.
